# Multi-user serving — the replica fleet

memra's engine owns one GPU per process (`Engine::new(0)`; `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is the
placement mechanism). Multi-GPU serving is therefore a **replica fleet**: N `memra-server`
processes fronted by an admission proxy. Tensor parallelism is a separate in-progress build
(M0 comms floor measured — ARCHITECTURE-H100.md).

## Tools

| tool | what it does |
|---|---|
| `tools/serve-fleet.sh start\|stop\|status\|restart` | declarative fleet supervisor: brings up `REPLICAS_PER_GPU` replicas per GPU in `GPUS`, fronts them with the proxy, health-loop restarts anything that dies. systemd-free; pidfiles under `$FLEET_RUN` |
| `tools/serve-proxy.py` | least-outstanding reverse proxy with per-backend admission cap (default 8 = the engine's exactness-tier batch width and the two-replicas-per-GPU anti-thrash bound). Bounded FIFO queue with deadline → 429 + Retry-After; `/health` + `/metrics` JSON |
| `tools/load-serve.py` | concurrent OpenAI-format load harness: aggregate output tok/s, p50/p95 latency, JSONL per load point |
| `tools/serve-smoke.sh` | OpenAI-surface smoke gate for a single server |

## Measured numbers (H100, Qwen3.5-9B Q8_0; receipts in `research/`)

- **Single replica:** temp-0.7 c=8/16/32 medians **654/657/659 tok/s** after the batched
  decode tick (z-batched FA + KV append, device sampling, lean logits — +25-36% over the
  pre-batched tick; N=4, `research/batched-tick-inc2-20260801/`).
- **Pair-packed fleet, 3 GPUs x 2 replicas:** **1,480 tok/s** aggregate direct, 0 errors;
  ~1,380 through the admission proxy at c=96 (~6-7% proxy overhead;
  `research/darklane-serving-20260801/REPORT.md`).
- **Spec fast lane:** MTP speculative serving is a single-stream latency tier — 1.82x plain
  serving at c=1 on the 27B (131.8 vs 72.5 tok/s); plain batching overtakes between c=2 and
  c=4, so spec and bulk tiers run as separate server processes (`MEMRA_SERVE_SPEC`;
  `research/spec-serving-20260801/`).

## Knobs

Serving flags (batch cap, device sampling, lean logits, prime batching, spec burst) are
cataloged in [FLAGS.md §7](FLAGS.md) under "Serving (memra-server)"; fleet topology knobs
(`GPUS`, `REPLICAS_PER_GPU`, `CAP`, ports, health cadence) are env-overridable at the top of
`tools/serve-fleet.sh`. The exactness contract holds under batching: the decode-batch gate
battery (gate1-3, gate3c lean-vs-full) runs inside `tools/validate-h100.sh`.
